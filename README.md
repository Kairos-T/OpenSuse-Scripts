# Scripts
Streamlining the installation and setup process for some stuff I used for Linux.

## Scripts
- [Discord Installation](https://github.com/Kairos-T/OpenSuse-Scripts/tree/main/Discord)
    - Compiles Discord from source and installs it. The script is for OpenSuSE, but it should work on other distros with minor modifications.
- [Fonts Installation](https://github.com/Kairos-T/OpenSuse-Scripts/tree/main/Fonts)
    - Fix missing fonts. Includes Windows pre-installed fonts, Simplified Chinese fonts, Math fonts and plenty more.
